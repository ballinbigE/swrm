  <strong>MCP-native kanban for parallel coding agents. Markdown-friendly. Localhost-first. <code>npx github:ballinbigE/swrm</code>.</strong>

## What

Swrm is a localhost web app that gives you a kanban board, a per-task workspace, and an agent runtime — all in one tool. Spawn parallel Claude Code / Codex / Gemini attempts on a task, each in its own git worktree. Comment on diffs. Re-prompt with feedback. Merge when ready. Drive the whole thing from inside Claude Code via the built-in MCP server.

## Why

Layered on top of three convictions:

1. **The PM tool should know about the agent.** Every kanban built for humans assumes the human types the work. Swrm assumes Claude does it, and the rep reviews.
2. **MCP-first.** Claude should read and write the board the same way it reads files. Swrm ships a JSON-RPC MCP server so `mcp__swrm__*` tools appear in Claude Code automatically.
3. **Localhost beats SaaS.** Your code, your DB, your machine. Apache 2.0, no telemetry, no account.

## Install

Straight from GitHub — no npm account, no registry:

```sh
# one-off run
npx github:ballinbigE/swrm
# clones, builds, opens http://localhost:5173
```

For a persistent `swrm` command, install it globally from GitHub:

```sh
npm i -g github:ballinbigE/swrm
swrm   # daily command, opens http://localhost:5173
```

That's it. SQLite DB lives at `.swrm/swrm.db` (gitignored). Press `s` in any workspace to spawn an attempt.

```

## Quickstart

1. `swrm` — boots dashboard at http://localhost:5173 (or `npx github:ballinbigE/swrm` for a one-off run).
2. On the home page, type an idea ("Build a dark-mode toggle for my app").
3. Click **Generate & Execute** — Claude breaks it into 3-12 user stories, you preview, save as `prd-<slug>.json`.
4. Go to **Tasks** → click any story → **+ Attempt**.
5. Spawn opens a fresh git worktree at `~/Library/Application Support/swrm/worktrees/task-N-M` on branch `attempt/task-N-M`.
6. Open the worktree in your editor (workspace has an Open-in-VSCode button). Make changes.
7. Diff updates in the workspace within 5s. Click any diff line to comment.
8. Press `r` to bundle comments into a reprompt; press `m` to merge into `main`.

## Plugins

Swrm ships with no preview plugins out of the box. Add one in `.swrmrc.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@swrm/preview-ios"]
}
```

Then `npm install @swrm/preview-ios`. The plugin matches tasks whose worktree contains an `ios/` directory and renders a live `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot` PNG in the workspace right pane.

Write your own — see the `PreviewPlugin` interface in `src/plugins/preview.d.ts`.

## MCP integration

Add to your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swrm": {
      "command": "swrm",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code will auto-load 11 `mcp__swrm__*` tools — `list_tasks`, `create_task`, `create_attempt`, etc. Now Claude can drive the board itself.

## Roadmap

Tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ballinbigE/swrm/issues). Notable upcoming:

- Skill Mode — scheduled Markdown skill cards ([architecture](docs/skill-mode-architecture.md)) — backend shipping; UI at `/skills`
- Cross-attempt diff compare (A vs B)
- WebSocket bidirectional MCP transport
- Built-in preview plugins for web (Playwright) + Storybook
- Cloud sync (opt-in, hosted tier — OSS core stays whole)

## Maintenance
